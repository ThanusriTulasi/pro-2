<p><h3>Fascinated by the script and box office performance of Mani Ratnam's Mouna Ragam (1986), Nagarjuna was keen on starring in a film directed by him. Nagarjuna revealed that he used to wait outside Ratnam's house every morning when the director would go on his daily walk to exchange conversation. After a month of regularly attempting to run into the director, Nagarjuna requested him to direct a Telugu film with him in the lead, which the director agreed to after initial reluctance, which became Geethanjali.It remains the only Telugu film directed by Ratnam.Girija was cast as the lead actress after Ratnam saw her at his wedding with Suhasini accompanying the sister of Krishnamachari Srikkanth. Girija's voice was dubbed by Rohini during post-production.</h3></p>
<p><h3>Principal photography began on 12 October 1988 and was completed in sixty working days. Most of the scenes were shot in Ooty and a few shots were filmed in Madras. Ratnam shot the film in the misty valleys of Ooty to give it a soft, poetic atmosphere. Filming would start early in the dawn, around 5 AM, and wrap up by about 11 AM. To capture the scenes in a dreamy atmosphere; the cast and crew had to arrive on location an hour before filming. In addition, an ice machine was brought from Madras to provide any additional mist if the shot did not look romantic enough.</h3></p>

            <p><h3>The story of this film is about how a man goes to the girl whose family is destroyed because of the unexpected folly done by his father. This movie is all about giving back. Bala Krishna's Samara Simha Reddy film also had similar point. Sravanthi Ravi Kishore's Ela Cheppanu film's basic storyline also has striking similarities.</h3></p>
<p><h3> Screenplay by National award winning Telugu director Sekhar Kammula is good. Direction of this film is excellent. This film oozes freshness and still retains local flavor. What makes Sekhar Kammula a different director is that he stuck to what he believed in and transformed it onto the silver screen the way he wanted it and made it in a way that all sensible movie lovers accept and appreciate it! Telugu Film Industry needs confident directors like Sekhar Kammula who dares to be different and strives to deliver the product with authenticity. However the following points should have been taken care of .</h3></p>

<p><h3>After Sekhar Kammula's first venture, Dollar Dreams (2000), he began meeting producers with his stories. When he initially told them a story, they felt that it was too simple. Then, he began giving them a bound script of Anand. Unfortunately, none came forward to produce it. Upon someone's suggestion, Kammula approached National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) and they came forward to fund a part of the project.This set a precedent because it was the first time that NFDC entered into commercial Telugu cinema.Anish Kuruvilla, who played Anand's cousin in the film, was the executive producer for the film and Kammula's following film, Godavari (2006).Cinematography by Vijay C Kumar (of Ankusam and Ammoru fame) is excellent. The color grading and lighting schemes are carefully crafted.Kammula preferred actors who suit the roles than writing characters for established actors. Hence, the choice of the cast were non-established actors.The search process lasted 3 months.The casting for Raja was simple. Kammula wanted someone without melodrama in acting and it just came as a plus when Raja appreciated Kammula's directorial abilities.The choice for an actress made Kammula visit Mumbai and Bangalore, but he could not get the appropriate one. On knowing about Kamalinee Mukherjee, he subjected her to a screen test. After the test, he selected her as the actress in the lead role.The choice of location was first thought as Ramoji Film City and Nanakramguda in Hyderabad. So, these thoughts were quashed because the need was for a suitably big house and an outhouse situated adjacent to it. Since Kammula stayed in Padmarao Nagar, a prominent locality in Hyderabad, a location there made it all the more accessible for him.</h3></p>
